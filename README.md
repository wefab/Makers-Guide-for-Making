# Makers-Guide-for-Making
Makers’ Guide for Making is an open source and ever evolving manual dedicated to spread all the FabLab culture around the world. You can download more posters like this for free in our website.
Use it and reinvent it the way you want. The project started with WeFab [wefab.cc] and Arnold [estudioarnold.cc] in 2016 in São Paulo — Brazil.
